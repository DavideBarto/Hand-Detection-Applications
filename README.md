## Introduction

The goal of this project is to explore different applications based on hand detection, enabling users to interact with computers through gestures. The applications developed include a finger painter, a rock-paper-scissors game, and a mouse controller. Each of these applications demonstrates the potential of computer vision to interpret and respond to hand movements.

## Features

- **Finger Painter**: Draw on the screen using hand gestures to select colors and brush sizes.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**: Play the classic game using hand gestures detected by the camera.
- **Mouse Controller**: Control the mouse pointer and perform clicks using hand gestures.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
